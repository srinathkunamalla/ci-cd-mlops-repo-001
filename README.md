`Streamlined CI/CD for Machine Learning:`
- Master the automation of your machine learning pipeline—covering model training, evaluation, version control, and deployment—with GitHub Actions. This comprehensive MLOps guide makes the entire process effortless.

`Project Overview:`
- In this project, we will utilize scikit-learn pipelines to train a random forest classifier for drug prediction. Continuous Machine Learning (CML) will be employed to automate the model evaluation, and the project culminates in the deployment of a web application to Hugging Face Hub.

- From start to finish, the entire process, including training, evaluation, and deployment, will be fully automated using GitHub Actions. Just push your code to the GitHub repository, and within minutes, the app, model, and performance results will be seamlessly updated on Hugging Face.
